    <p class="para">ted talk: the power of small decisions

        every morning, i face a decision: black coffee or chai
        it seems trivial. but today, i want to show you how the smallest decisions can shape the biggest outcomes in our
        lives

        let me take you back a few years. i was stuck‚Äîburnt out, directionless, constantly thinking i needed one big
        moment to change everything. i was waiting for the perfect opportunity, the big break, the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment that
        would flip my life around

        but instead, it came in the form of a small choice
        i started waking up 30 minutes earlier
        just 30 minutes. to read. reflect. and write one paragraph a day
        that tiny decision‚Ä¶ repeated over time‚Ä¶ reshaped my thinking, built confidence, and eventually became a habit
        that habit became a blog. that blog became a business. that business changed my life

        we‚Äôre conditioned to think transformation is big and loud
        but change is quiet. it begins in the margins of your day, in the micro-decisions you barely notice

        choosing to speak up in a meeting
        saying no when it‚Äôs uncomfortable
        taking a walk instead of scrolling your phone

        these small decisions are votes for the kind of person you want to become

        so the next time you‚Äôre overwhelmed by where to start, remember this
        you don‚Äôt need to leap
        you just need to step
        choose the small decision that aligns with the life you want
        then choose it again tomorrow
        and again the day after that

        because over time, small decisions don‚Äôt stay small
        they build momentum
        they build character
        and eventually‚Ä¶ they build a new you

        thank you</p>
